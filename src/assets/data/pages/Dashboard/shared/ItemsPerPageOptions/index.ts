/* This code snippet is defining a constant array named `itemsPerPageOptions` in TypeScript. Each
element in the array is an object with two properties: `value` and `label`. These objects represent
options for the number of items to display per page in a user interface, with values of 5, 10, 25,
50, and 100 respectively. The `export` keyword makes this array available for use in other modules. */
