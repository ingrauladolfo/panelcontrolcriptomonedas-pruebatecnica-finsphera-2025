/* This code snippet is defining an interface named `CryptoHeatmapProps` in TypeScript. This interface
has a single property `data` which is optional and can hold any type of value (`any`). By using this
interface, you can define the structure of objects that should have a `data` property of any type
when implementing or using the `CryptoHeatmapProps` interface. The `export` keyword makes this
interface available for use in other files or modules. */
